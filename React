Media queries in inline styles.
Radium is a higher order component so first you

And in the export line you should use Raduim as a HOC.
Radium is all about styles.

You can use in your style object in your componenet like this:
':hover' or any other pseudo selectors.
For example:
const style = {
':hover':{

from radium package as a named import.
then wrap all entire your application with this 
StyleRoot component then
in your style use 
'@media (min-width: 500px)':{
 backgroundColor:'red',
 .
